# Kyunnect
#### A Snap plug manager.

This is a simple app made using PyQt6.

Kyunnect can't manage all available plugs, only the simplest ones, such as removable-media, joystick, bluez, etc.

Kyunnect's goal is to provide a simple way to connect and disconnect plugs without needing to use the terminal.
Ubuntu Desktop already has something like this, but it's only within the Gnome settings; flavors can't be accessed.
